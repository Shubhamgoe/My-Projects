Stage 1: Core Functionality and Basic Architecture 'by 28 Novem'
'Goals:
Set up a foundational system for real-time text editing with multiple users.
Establish WebSocket-based communication for real-time updates.
Implement a basic client-server model for collaborative editing.
Tasks:
Frontend:

Create a simple UI with a text editor (e.g., using CodeMirror or Monaco Editor).
Enable real-time updates for every keypress.
Display the list of active collaborators in a session.
Backend:

Build a WebSocket server to handle real-time data streams (e.g., using Node.js with ws, Django Channels, or Socket.IO).
Manage user connections and maintain a session for each collaborative document.
Broadcast changes received from one client to all other connected clients.
Data Flow:

Decide on a basic data model:
Document ID
User ID
Operations (e.g., insert, delete, update text)
No persistence yetâ€”just handle changes in memory.
Outcome:
A simple collaborative text editor where users can join a session, edit a shared document in real time, and see each others changes.'

Stage 2: Adding Persistence and Scalability  'by 2 December'
'Goals:
Ensure document changes are persisted for future sessions.
Handle scalability for multiple users and documents.
Implement version control or history tracking for undo/redo functionality.
Tasks:
Backend Enhancements:

Use a database (e.g., PostgreSQL, MongoDB, or Redis) to store:
Document contents.
User metadata.
Edit history or operation logs.
Introduce a messaging queue (e.g., RabbitMQ or Kafka) to handle high concurrency:
Queue incoming changes.
Broadcast changes in a fault-tolerant manner.
Frontend Enhancements:

Add undo/redo functionality:
Use operation logs from the backend to reconstruct document states.
Indicate edit conflicts or prevent overwrites when two users make simultaneous changes.
Scalability:

Design for horizontal scaling:
Add load balancers for WebSocket connections.
Use a distributed message broker to manage updates across servers.
Outcome:
A scalable, persistent collaborative editor that can handle undo/redo and multiple documents across sessions.'

Stage 3: Conflict Resolution and Advanced Collaboration Features 'by 6 december'
'Goals:
Resolve conflicting edits effectively.
Improve user experience with advanced collaboration features.
Tasks:
Conflict Resolution:

Implement algorithms like:
Operational Transform (OT): Converts edits into a sequence of operations.
Conflict-Free Replicated Data Types (CRDTs): Ensures consistency without central coordination.
Ensure users always see the same document state in real-time.
Advanced Collaboration Features:

Real-time cursors: Display where collaborators are editing.
Highlight text edited by each user in real-time.
Add comments or suggestions on specific lines or blocks of code.
Implement role-based access control (RBAC):
E.g., editors, viewers, and commenters.
Frontend Enhancements:

Add user avatars or initials for collaborative indicators.
Show live collaboration metrics (e.g., active users, typing speed).
Outcome:
A robust and feature-rich editor that supports real-time conflict resolution and advanced collaboration.'


Stage 4: Production-Grade Features and Optimization
'Goals:
Prepare the application for production use.
Optimize for performance and handle large-scale traffic.
Tasks:
Security and Authentication:

Add OAuth or single sign-on (SSO) for user authentication.
Use HTTPS for secure WebSocket connections (wss://).
Implement rate limiting and DDoS protection.
Performance Optimization:

Reduce bandwidth usage:
Send deltas (minimal updates) instead of full document states.
Optimize WebSocket handling with connection pooling and heartbeat mechanisms.
Cache frequently accessed data using Redis or similar tools.
Monitoring and Analytics:

Integrate logging and monitoring tools (e.g., Prometheus, Grafana, or ELK Stack).
Track metrics such as:
Active sessions.
Average latency.
Conflict rates.
Frontend Enhancements:

Add offline mode:
Synchronize changes when the user reconnects.
Improve the UI/UX for large documents or complex collaboration scenarios.
Outcome:
A highly scalable, production-ready collaborative code editor with excellent performance and user experience.'
